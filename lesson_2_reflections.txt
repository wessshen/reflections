What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create an empty repository with no files tracked, but tracking files is needed to create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area works as a place where you can keep track of files that will be tracked in the next commit, while working directory is simply a place that contains all the files that can possibly be tracked and the repository is the space where all the commits made are stored.
