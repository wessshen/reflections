When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to work on a project with other people or to access the project from more than one computer, using a remote repository would be a good idea so you don't have to always work on the same computer and still pull the update branch(es) from the remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If Git just stays up-to-date all the time, conflicts can happen more easily, and you may want to be working on a similar feature as the one in the repository without creating a brand new brnach.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of repositories that are specifically done on GitHub, while clones are basically forks but somehow involve a local repository. Branches are just a series of commits and not a whole repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can then be able to compare commits offline and merge them.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You can manually share files on platforms such as Google Drive and Dropbox. However, version control would be much harder since versions are created automatically, making the differences between versions insignificant.
