When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to work on a project with other people or to access the project from more than one computer, using a remote repository would be a good idea so you don't have to always work on the same computer and still pull the update branch(es) from the remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If Git just stays up-to-date all the time, conflicts can happen more easily, and you may want to be working on a similar feature as the one in the repository without creating a brand new brnach.
